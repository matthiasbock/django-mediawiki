#summary Django Database Compatibility

= Django Database =

 * each table requires a primary key, which must be an auto-incrementing integer
 * by default this primary key is called "id" or "ID", but may be renamed manually in the models.py of your Django app
 * other kinds of special database table keys are disencouraged
 * in Django all table and column names are lowercase
